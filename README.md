ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kim

I'm a software developer who currently mainly works with Python. 
I also have professional experience with Java, JavaScript and TypeScript.
At work I build integrations, migrations as well as full stack web services 
and in my free time I like to mess around with home automation.

- Docker, Docker Compose
- Maven 
- Java:
  - Spring
  - Camel
  - Hibernate
  - Lombok
- Python:
  - Apache Airflow
  - Fast API
